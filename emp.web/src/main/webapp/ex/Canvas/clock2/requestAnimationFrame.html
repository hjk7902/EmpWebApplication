            The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">requestAnimationFrame API</a> 
            gives web developers a means to create power efficient and smooth animations.
            This API will take page visibility and the display's refresh rate into account to 
            determine how many frames per second to allocate to the animation. 
            In this demo, the left clock animation is powered by <code>setTimeout</code>, and
            the right clock animation is powered by <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. The time 
            shown is the same as both clocks are animated using time based animation. However, 
            the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> based clock is smoother and more efficient. 
            Try changing the setTimeout period or minimizing your browser to see the difference in efficiency.

       <h4>About the requestAnimationFrame API</h4>
        <p>
            Until now, the web platform did not provide an efficient means for web developers
            to schedule graphics timers for animations. Animations are commonly overdrawing ?
            causing choppier animations and increased power consumption. Further efficiency is 
            lost as animations are drawn without knowledge of whether the page is visible to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
           For example, most animations use a timer period of less than 16.7ms to draw animations, 
           even though most monitors can only display at 60Hz frequency or 16.7ms periods. For example,
           using setTimeout with a 10ms period results in every third callback not being painted, as
           another callback occurs prior to the display refresh. This overdrawing results in not only
           choppy animations, as every third frame being lost, but an overall increased resource consumption. 
           This can be seen in the power consumption and CPU efficiency ratings above. Try changing the setTimeout period;
           you will be able to see that the animation on the left is slightly choppy and has a higher
           resource consumption than the animation on the right. 
        </p>
        <p>
           The requestAnimationFrame API also takes the visibility of the page into account. Without knowing 
           the visibility state of a page, timers typically fire as if the page is always visible. Try minimizing
           the browser for a few moments and then return to this demo. You will notice that the animation 
           using requestAnimationFrame has had fewer callbacks than the animation using setTimeout. This is 
           because requestAnimationFrame will automatically throttle callbacks when the page is not visible, to be
           more power conscious. Because of this reason, setTimeout always has higher background interference than 
           requestAnimationFrame.
        </p>
        <p>
           The requestAnimationFrame API is being designed in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web 
           Performance Working Group</a>. As this API is an emerging standard, this interface has been implemented 
           with a <code>ms</code> vendor prefix. Special thanks to the Google, Mozilla and other members of the working 
           group in helping design this interface.
